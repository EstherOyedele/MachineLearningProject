K-Means is a partitioning method that divides a dataset into $k$ distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters).

#### **How it Works**

1.  **Initialization:** Randomly select $k$ data points as initial cluster centroids.

2.  **Assignment:** Assign each data point to the cluster whose centroid is closest.

3.  **Update:** Recalculate the cluster centroids based on the assigned points.

4.  **Repeat:** Iterate steps 2 and 3 until convergence (minimal change in cluster assignments).

```{r}
# K-Means clustering example using built-in dataset iris
data <- iris[, 1:4]  # Selecting relevant features
kmeans_result <- kmeans(data, centers = 3)  # Clustering into 3 groups

# Display cluster assignments
cat("Cluster Assignments:", kmeans_result$cluster, "\n")

# Display cluster centroids
cat("Cluster Centroids:\n", kmeans_result$centers, "\n")

# Scatter plot with cluster assignments
plot(data[, c(1, 2)], col = kmeans_result$cluster, main = "K-Means Clustering", 
     xlab = "Sepal Length", ylab = "Sepal Width")

# Plotting cluster centroids
points(kmeans_result$centers[, c(1, 2)], col = 1:3, pch = 8, cex = 2)

```
