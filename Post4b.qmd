title: "Decision Trees for Classification"
---

A decision tree is a tree-like model where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of the decision, and each leaf node represents the class label.

#### **How it Works**

1.  **Feature Selection**: Choose the feature that best splits the data into classes (based on criteria like Gini impurity or information gain).

2.  **Splitting:** Create a branch for each possible value of the selected feature.

3.  **Repeat:** Recursively apply steps 1 and 2 to each subset of data until a stopping criterion is met.

4.  **Leaf Nodes:** Assign a class label to each leaf node.

```{r}
# Decision tree example using built-in dataset iris
library(rpart)

# Creating a decision tree model
tree_model <- rpart(Species ~ ., data = iris, method = "class")

# Displaying the decision tree plot
plot(tree_model)
text(tree_model)

```
