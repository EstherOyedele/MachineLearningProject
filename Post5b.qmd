**Z-Score Method**

-   Calculates the Z-score for each data point, representing how many standard deviations it is from the mean.

-   Points with a Z-score above a certain threshold are considered outliers.

**Example:** Outlier Detection using Z-Score

```{r}
# Outlier detection using Z-score
data <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31)

# Calculate Z-scores
z_scores <- (data - mean(data)) / sd(data)

# Set Z-score threshold for outliers
z_threshold <- 2

# Identify outliers
outliers <- abs(z_scores) > z_threshold

# Display identified outliers
cat("Outliers:", data[outliers], "\n")

# Scatter plot with highlighted outliers
plot(1:length(data), data, pch = ifelse(outliers, 19, 1), main = "Scatter Plot with Outliers", xlab = "Index", ylab = "Values")

```
