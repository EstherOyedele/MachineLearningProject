Linear regression aims to find the best-fit linear relationship between a dependent variable ($Y$) and one or more independent variables ($X$). The goal is to model the underlying pattern in the data, making it a valuable tool for prediction and understanding the relationships between variables.

#### **Linear Regression Model**

**Model Equation**

$Y=β0​+β1​X1​+β2​X2​+…+βn​Xn​+ε$

-   $Y$ is the dependent variable.

-   $X1​,X2​,…,Xn​$ are the independent variables.

-   $β0​,β1​,…,βn​$ are the model coefficients.

-   $ε$ is the error term.

# Linear regression example using built-in dataset mtcars
linear_model <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)  # Predicting mpg based on horsepower

# Display regression summary
summary(linear_model)

# Scatter plot with linear regression line
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg, main = "Linear Regression", xlab = "Horsepower", ylab = "Miles Per Gallon")

# Adding regression line
abline(linear_model, col = "red")
